          <h1>Tips On How To Train Your Dog Through Furevercare Academy</h1>
          <p>While many online dog training courses may prove overwhelming to those training a pet for the first time, Pettable Academy is designed to be digestable and empowering – allowing you to move at the pace most comfortable for you and your pet to ensure every lesson is impactful and meaningful.</p>
          <p>To get you started with Pettable Academy, here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when beginning online dog training.</p>
          <h3>1. Your pet’s health is key</h3>
          <p style="padding-top: 10px;">Just like the rest of us, it takes time, repetition and a few mistakes along the way for your pet to get used to the new skills you are teaching it. Dog training can vary in length based on your schedule, your preferred pace, your dog’s ability not to get overwhelmed and your pet's level of obedience when beginning training. Be sure you are patient with both yourself and your pup to get the best results. </p>
          <h3>2. Go slowly</h3>
          <p style="padding-top: 10px;">Just like the rest of us, it takes time, repetition and a few mistakes along the way for your pet to get used to the new skills you are teaching it. Dog training can vary in length based on your schedule, your preferred pace, your dog’s ability not to get overwhelmed and your pet's level of obedience when beginning training. Be sure you are patient with both yourself and your pup to get the best results. </p>
          <h3>3. Your dog is always learning</h3>
          <p style="padding-top: 10px;">Whether your dog is a psychiatric service dog or just a pet, it is always learning. Paying close attention to both your dog’s actions and your actions when around your dog to ensure you are reinforcing positive behavior is key to your dog’s willingness to engage in psychiatric service dog training tasks. Remember, treats are key!</p>
